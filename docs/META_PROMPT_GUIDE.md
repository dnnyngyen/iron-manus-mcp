# Iron Manus MCP Meta-Prompt Architecture Guide

**Version**: v0.2.4  
**System**: 8-Phase FSM with Meta Thread-of-Thought (THoT) Orchestration

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for Iron Manus MCP's meta-prompt DSL (Domain Specific Language) and Meta Thread-of-Thought orchestration system used for fractal agent spawning and task delegation.

## Overview

Meta-prompts are specialized instruction patterns that enable **fractal orchestration** through autonomous Task() agent spawning. They bridge high-level strategic planning with specialized execution by creating focused context windows for independent Claude instances with role-specific expertise.

The Iron Manus MCP implements a **Meta Thread-of-Thought (THoT) orchestration** pattern where:
1. The main FSM orchestrator manages the 8-phase workflow (INIT → QUERY → ENHANCE → KNOWLEDGE → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → DONE)
2. Meta-prompts embedded in todo items trigger Task() agent spawning during the EXECUTE phase
3. Each Task() agent operates as an independent Claude instance with specialized context and fresh working memory
4. Results flow back to the main orchestrator for integration and verification

## Core Syntax

### Basic Structure

## Meta Thread-of-Thought (THoT) Orchestration

### Architecture Overview

The Iron Manus MCP implements a sophisticated **THoT orchestration pattern** that segments complex objectives into specialized contexts:

```
Main FSM Orchestrator (8-Phase Loop)
├── PLAN Phase: Creates todos with embedded meta-prompts
├── EXECUTE Phase: Extracts meta-prompts and spawns Task() agents
└── VERIFY Phase: Integrates results and validates completion

Task() Agent Instances (Independent Claude)
├── Fresh context window with role-specific enhancement
├── Specialized thinking methodologies and frameworks
├── Autonomous execution with TodoWrite decomposition
└── Result reporting back to main orchestrator
```

### FSM Integration Points

#### PLAN Phase: Meta-Prompt Generation

The PLAN phase embeds meta-prompts into todo items using the fractal orchestration protocol:

```typescript
// src/phase-engine/FSM.ts:461 - Fractal orchestration guidance
prompt += `\n\n**🔄 FRACTAL ORCHESTRATION GUIDE:**
For complex sub-tasks that need specialized expertise, create todos with this format:
"(ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: authentication_system) (PROMPT: Implement secure JWT authentication with password reset) (OUTPUT: production_ready_code)"

This enables Task() agent spawning in the EXECUTE phase.`;
```

#### EXECUTE Phase: Agent Spawning

The EXECUTE phase detects meta-prompt patterns and triggers Task() agent spawning:

```typescript
// src/phase-engine/FSM.ts:536-553 - Meta-prompt extraction
export function extractMetaPromptFromTodo(todoContent: string): MetaPrompt | null {
  const roleMatch = todoContent.match(/\(ROLE:\s*([^)]+)\)/i);
  const contextMatch = todoContent.match(/\(CONTEXT:\s*([^)]+)\)/i);
  const promptMatch = todoContent.match(/\(PROMPT:\s*([^)]+)\)/i);
  const outputMatch = todoContent.match(/\(OUTPUT:\s*([^)]+)\)/i);

  if (roleMatch && promptMatch) {
    return {
      role_specification: roleMatch[1].trim(),
      context_parameters: contextMatch ? { domain: contextMatch[1].trim() } : {},
      instruction_block: promptMatch[1].trim(),
      output_requirements: outputMatch ? outputMatch[1].trim() : 'comprehensive_deliverable',
    };
  }
  return null;
}
```

#### Task() Tool Integration

When meta-prompts are detected, the system converts them to Task() agent spawning:

```typescript
// Task() agent spawning pattern from EXECUTE phase
const metaPrompt = extractMetaPromptFromTodo(currentTodo);
if (metaPrompt) {
  // Spawn independent Claude instance with specialized context
  Task({
    description: `(ROLE: ${metaPrompt.role_specification}) (CONTEXT: ${metaPrompt.context_parameters.domain}) (PROMPT: ${briefDescription}) (OUTPUT: ${metaPrompt.output_requirements})`,
    prompt: generateRoleEnhancedPrompt(metaPrompt) // Enhanced with role-specific thinking methodologies
  });
}
```

### Context Segmentation Strategy

THoT orchestration implements **context segmentation** to manage complexity:

1. **Main Orchestrator Context**: Manages strategic workflow, phase transitions, and integration
2. **Specialized Agent Context**: Focused on specific technical implementation with role expertise
3. **Result Integration Context**: Merges specialized outputs into coherent deliverables

This approach prevents context pollution while enabling deep specialization for complex sub-tasks.

## Agent Context Isolation and Communication Patterns

### Critical Limitation: Complete Context Isolation

**IMPORTANT**: Task() agents spawn with **completely fresh, isolated contexts**:

#### What Agents CANNOT Do:
- Access variables or data from the spawning agent
- Directly receive output from other Task() agents  
- Share memory or state with other agents
- Inherit context from the main orchestrator
- Access session state or payload data directly

#### What Agents CAN Do:
- Read and write files with explicit file paths
- Use all available tools independently (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
- Work on tasks defined in their prompts
- Report results through their final output
- Create their own TodoWrite decompositions

### Session Workspace Pattern

**File-Based Communication Protocol:**

```
1. Main orchestrator creates: /tmp/iron-manus-session-{session_id}/
2. Agents write to: /tmp/iron-manus-session-{session_id}/agent_name_output.md
3. Synthesis agent reads all files and combines results
4. Main orchestrator reads final synthesis
5. Session data flows back to FSM through JARVIS payload
```

**Example Session Workspace Structure:**
```
/tmp/iron-manus-session-abc123/
├── primary_research.md      (from researcher agent)
├── analysis_data.md         (from analyzer agent)  
├── technical_specs.md       (from coder agent)
├── expert_review.md         (from critic agent)
└── synthesized_knowledge.md (from synthesizer agent)
```

### Best Practices for Agent Communication

#### 1. **Always Specify Exact File Paths in Meta-Prompts**
```
Bad: "(PROMPT: Research topic and save results)"
Good: "(PROMPT: Research topic and write findings to /tmp/iron-manus-session-{session_id}/research_output.md)"
```

#### 2. **Use Session-Specific Directories**
```
Bad: "/tmp/research_output.md" (conflicts with other sessions)
Good: "/tmp/iron-manus-session-{session_id}/research_output.md"
```

#### 3. **Include File Writing Instructions in Meta-Prompts**
```
Example: "(PROMPT: Analyze data patterns and write detailed analysis to /tmp/iron-manus-session-{session_id}/analysis.md with sections for findings, metrics, and recommendations)"
```

#### 4. **Design for File-Based Handoffs, Not Direct Context Passing**
```
Bad: Sequential agents expecting context inheritance
Good: Parallel agents writing to files + synthesis agent reading all files
```

#### 5. **PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION for Research Agents**
```
Enhanced Meta-Prompt with Batch Optimization:
"(PROMPT: Research microservices architecture using PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple WebSearch/WebFetch calls in a single response for maximum speed, then write comprehensive findings to /tmp/iron-manus-session-{session_id}/research.md)"
```

**Parallel Search Techniques:**
- **WebSearch Batching**: Multiple search queries in one tool call batch
- **WebFetch Parallel**: Simultaneous URL fetching from multiple sources  
- **APITaskAgent**: Unified API research workflow with discovery, validation, and data gathering
- **Cross-Domain Research**: Batch searches across different knowledge domains

**Example Optimized Research Pattern:**
```typescript
// Agent receives instruction to batch these calls:
WebSearch("microservices benefits scalability")
WebSearch("microservices team autonomy")  
WebSearch("microservices technology diversity")
WebFetch("https://example.com/microservices-guide")
WebFetch("https://example.com/architecture-patterns")
// All in a single response for maximum parallelization
```

### Data Flow Integration with FSM

**Critical Session State Requirements:**

Each phase expects specific data in `session.payload`:
- **KNOWLEDGE**: Must populate `knowledge_gathered` field
- **PLAN**: Must include `plan_created: true` and `todos_with_metaprompts`
- **EXECUTE**: Supports full payload merge with `Object.assign(session.payload, input.payload)`

**Agent Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// 1. Agents write to session workspace files
// 2. Main orchestrator reads synthesis file
// 3. JARVIS call includes required payload fields:
JARVIS({
  phase_completed: 'KNOWLEDGE',
  payload: {
    knowledge_gathered: synthesizedContentFromFile,
    // ... other expected fields
  }
});
```

## Claude-Powered Intelligent Role Selection

Iron Manus MCP v0.2.4 implements **Claude-powered role selection** that surpasses simple keyword matching:

### QUERY Phase Role Detection

During the QUERY phase, the system generates an intelligent role selection prompt for Claude:

```typescript
// src/core/prompts.ts:157-250 - Role selection prompt generation
export function generateRoleSelectionPrompt(objective: string): string {
  return `# Role Selection for Task Execution

## Objective
${objective}

## Available Roles (9 total)
[Detailed role descriptions with thinking methodologies...]

## Your Task
Analyze the objective and select the SINGLE most appropriate role for this task.

## Response Format
Return a JSON object with your role selection:
\`\`\`json
{
  "selected_role": "role_name",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation why this role is optimal"
}
\`\`\``;
}
```

### Intelligent Role Processing

The FSM processes Claude's intelligent role selection:

```typescript
// src/phase-engine/FSM.ts:97-124 - Claude role selection processing
if (session.payload.awaiting_role_selection && input.payload?.claude_response) {
  try {
    const claudeSelectedRole = parseClaudeRoleSelection(
      input.payload.claude_response,
      session.initial_objective || ''
    );
    session.detected_role = claudeSelectedRole;
    session.payload.awaiting_role_selection = false;
    console.log(`SUCCESS Claude selected role: ${claudeSelectedRole}`);
  } catch (error) {
    // Graceful fallback to hardcoded detection
    session.payload.awaiting_role_selection = false;
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Claude-Powered Selection

1. **Context Understanding**: Claude analyzes nuanced requirements beyond keyword matching
2. **Domain Expertise**: Intelligent selection considers task complexity and role specialization
3. **Adaptive Selection**: Dynamic role selection based on full objective context
4. **Fallback Safety**: Graceful degradation to keyword-based detection if needed

## Single-Tool-Per-Iteration Enforcement

The system enforces **Manus compliance** through strict tool gating:

```typescript
// src/core/prompts.ts:1008-1041 - Phase tool restrictions
export const PHASE_ALLOWED_TOOLS: Record<Phase, string[]> = {
  INIT: ['JARVIS'],
  QUERY: ['JARVIS'],
  ENHANCE: ['JARVIS'],
  KNOWLEDGE: ['WebSearch', 'WebFetch', 'APITaskAgent', 'KnowledgeSynthesize', 'JARVIS'],
  PLAN: ['TodoWrite'],
  EXECUTE: ['TodoRead', 'TodoWrite', 'Task', 'Bash', 'Read', 'Write', 'Edit', 'Browser'],
  VERIFY: ['TodoRead', 'Read'],
  DONE: []
};
```

This ensures **single tool per iteration** while providing Claude with appropriate tool choices for each phase.

## Performance and Reasoning Effectiveness Tracking

The system tracks performance metrics throughout the workflow:

```typescript
// Reasoning effectiveness adaptation (src/phase-engine/FSM.ts:375-380)
if (input.payload.execution_success) {
  session.reasoning_effectiveness = Math.min(1.0, session.reasoning_effectiveness + 0.1);
} else {
  session.reasoning_effectiveness = Math.max(0.3, session.reasoning_effectiveness - 0.1);
}
```

Performance metrics include:
- **Reasoning Effectiveness**: 0.3-1.0 scale with adaptive optimization
- **Phase Transition Count**: Tracking workflow efficiency
- **API Usage Metrics**: Auto-connection performance and confidence scores
- **Task Completion Rates**: Success/failure tracking for continuous improvement

---
