/**
 * @fileoverview Advanced Prompt Generation Engine for Iron Manus MCP
 *
 * This module implements sophisticated prompt generation and role detection systems that form
 * the cognitive core of the Iron Manus MCP orchestration framework. It replaces Manus's
 * traditional Planner/Knowledge/Datasource modules with an advanced 8-phase FSM-driven
 * system enhanced with role-aware cognitive frameworks and fractal orchestration capabilities.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - 9 specialized cognitive roles with thinking methodologies
 * - Component-Cognitive Duality for UI/UX generation
 * - Unified constraint systems across component/project/ecosystem scopes
 * - Fractal task decomposition with meta-prompt generation
 * - Role-specific API guidance and tool selection
 * - Parallel agent orchestration with session workspace coordination
 *
 * The system uses Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities for intelligent role selection,
 * moving beyond simple keyword matching to contextual understanding of task requirements.

- How should findings be synthesized for maximum insight?

**🚀 PARALLEL RESEARCH ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL:**

1. **CREATE SESSION WORKSPACE**: First establish agent communication infrastructure:
   \`mkdir -p ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}\`

2. **SPAWN SPECIALIZED RESEARCH AGENTS** (3-5 agents working in parallel):

**Core Research Agents:**
- Primary Researcher: "(ROLE: researcher) (CONTEXT: primary_domain_research) (PROMPT: Conduct comprehensive research on core topic requirements using PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple WebSearch/WebFetch calls in a single response for maximum speed, then write detailed findings to ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/primary_research.md) (OUTPUT: research_report)"

- Data Analyzer: "(ROLE: analyzer) (CONTEXT: quantitative_analysis) (PROMPT: Research and analyze quantitative aspects, metrics, performance data using PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple APITaskAgent calls simultaneously for faster data gathering, then write analytical insights to ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/analysis_data.md) (OUTPUT: analytical_insights)"

- Technical Specialist: "(ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: technical_implementation) (PROMPT: Research technical approaches, frameworks, tools using PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple WebSearch/WebFetch calls in parallel for rapid information gathering, then write specifications to ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/technical_specs.md) (OUTPUT: technical_specifications)"

**Optional Specialized Agents** (based on objective complexity):
- Domain Expert: "(ROLE: critic) (CONTEXT: domain_expertise) (PROMPT: Research best practices, security considerations using PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple WebSearch/APITaskAgent calls for comprehensive coverage, then write expert recommendations to ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/expert_review.md) (OUTPUT: expert_recommendations)"

3. **COORDINATION PROTOCOL**:
   - Each agent writes findings to designated session workspace files
   - Agents work independently with no direct context sharing
   - Wait for all research agents to complete before synthesis

4. **SYNTHESIS PHASE**:
   After all research agents complete, spawn synthesis agent:
   "(ROLE: synthesizer) (CONTEXT: knowledge_integration) (PROMPT: Read all research files from ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/ directory, cross-validate findings, resolve contradictions, and if additional research is needed use PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple WebSearch/APITaskAgent calls for gap-filling, then write comprehensive synthesized knowledge to ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/synthesized_knowledge.md) (OUTPUT: synthesized_knowledge)"

5. **INTEGRATION AND COMPLETION**:
   - Read the synthesized_knowledge.md file from ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/
   - Integrate findings into session knowledge base
   - Call JARVIS with phase_completed: 'KNOWLEDGE' and include comprehensive findings in payload as 'knowledge_gathered'

**🔄 FALLBACK TO TRADITIONAL RESEARCH:**
If Task() agent spawning isn't suitable for the objective, use traditional tools:
- WebSearch/WebFetch for supplementary research  
- APITaskAgent for structured data source research
- For knowledge integration: spawn synthesizer agent: "(ROLE: synthesizer) (CONTEXT: knowledge_integration) (PROMPT: Synthesize findings from research using systematic integration methodologies) (OUTPUT: integrated_knowledge)"

**📋 CRITICAL AGENT COMMUNICATION RULES:**
- Task() agents have isolated contexts and cannot directly share data
- All inter-agent communication MUST use session workspace files
- Always specify exact file paths in agent prompts
- Session workspace: ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/

Choose your research approach based on objective complexity and proceed accordingly.`,

  PLAN: `You are in the PLAN phase (Manus Planner Module). Your task:

Think strategically about how to break down this goal. Consider:
- What is the optimal task breakdown strategy for this specific goal?
- Which tasks require specialized Task() agent expertise vs direct execution?
- What are the dependencies, sequencing, and timeline considerations?
- What complexity challenges might arise during execution?
- How can you ensure the plan is actionable and efficient?

After strategic analysis, proceed with:
1. Break down the enhanced goal into specific, actionable steps
2. Use TodoWrite to create a detailed task breakdown
3. For complex sub-tasks that need specialized expertise, embed MetaPrompt structure in todo content
4. Format complex todos as: "(ROLE: agent_type) (CONTEXT: domain_info) (PROMPT: detailed_instructions) (OUTPUT: deliverables)"
5. After creating todos, call JARVIS with phase_completed: 'PLAN' and include 'plan_created': true in payload.

**FRACTAL ORCHESTRATION:** Mark todos that should spawn Task() agents with detailed meta-prompts. Use TodoWrite now.`,

  EXECUTE: `You are in the EXECUTE phase (Manus Datasource Module). Your task:

Think through your execution strategy before taking action. Analyze:
- What is the current task complexity and scope?
- What is the optimal execution approach for this specific task?
- Should you use direct tools or spawn specialized Task() agents?
- Can parallel agent coordination improve efficiency?
- What potential challenges might you encounter?
- What mitigation strategies should you have ready?

**📂 SESSION WORKSPACE AVAILABLE**: ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/
Use this workspace for agent coordination and file-based communication.

After analyzing the execution approach, proceed with:

**🔄 PARALLEL EXECUTION ORCHESTRATION:**
For complex objectives, consider spawning multiple Task() agents in parallel:

1. **Check Current Tasks**: Use TodoRead to see your current tasks
2. **PARALLEL SPAWNING STRATEGY**: For complex work, spawn 2-4 specialized Task() agents simultaneously:
   - Implementation agents for different components
   - Validation agents for testing and quality assurance  
   - Integration agents for system coordination
   - Use session workspace for agent file coordination

3. **Meta-Prompt Agent Spawning**: For todos with meta-prompts (ROLE/CONTEXT/PROMPT/OUTPUT), spawn Task() agents with enhanced file coordination
4. **Direct Execution**: For direct execution todos, use Bash, Browser, Read, Write, Edit tools
5. **Coordination Protocol**: Monitor agent results using session workspace files
6. **Single tool per iteration** (Manus requirement) - but can spawn multiple Task() agents in one iteration

## Enhanced Task() Tool Usage:
When you see a todo formatted as "(ROLE: agent_type) (CONTEXT: domain) (PROMPT: instructions) (OUTPUT: deliverable)", convert it to:

Task() with parameters:
- description: Use the structured format: "(ROLE: agent_type) (CONTEXT: domain) (PROMPT: brief_task_description) (OUTPUT: deliverable)"
- prompt: Enhanced version with detailed context, implementation guidance, role-specific methodologies, and **session workspace file coordination instructions**

**Agent File Coordination Pattern:**
Include in Task() prompts: "Write your results to ./iron-manus-sessions/{{session_id}}/agent_[role]_output.md"

**PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION for Task Agents:**
Include in Task() prompts: "Use PARALLEL SEARCH OPTIMIZATION: batch multiple WebSearch/WebFetch/APITaskAgent calls in a single response for maximum research speed"

The Task() tool creates an independent Claude instance that:
- Starts with fresh context
- Has access to the same tools you do
- Works autonomously on the specific task
- **Communicates through session workspace files**
- Reports back when complete

**PARALLEL EXECUTION FRAMEWORK:** Automatically recognize when parallel execution would improve efficiency and spawn appropriate specialized agents with proper file coordination.

Use Task() for complex work requiring specialized expertise. Use direct tools for simple operations.`,

  VERIFY: `You are in the VERIFY phase (Quality Assessment). Your task:

Think critically about the quality and completeness of the work. Evaluate:
- How do the actual deliverables compare to the original objective?
- Have all requirements been met according to role-specific quality standards?
- What gaps or improvements might be needed?
- What are the success criteria and have they been achieved?
- What is the best approach to verify functionality and quality?

**🔗 HOOK INTEGRATION:** Before making your final decision, review any structured feedback from validation hooks. If a block decision was issued, you must address the reason in your next step.

After thorough quality assessment, proceed with:
1. Review the original objective against what was delivered
2. Check if all requirements were met with role-specific quality standards
3. Test functionality if applicable
4. Identify any gaps or improvements needed
5. Call JARVIS with phase_completed: 'VERIFY' and include 'verification_passed': true/false in payload.

Apply rigorous quality assessment with your specialized validation expertise.`,
