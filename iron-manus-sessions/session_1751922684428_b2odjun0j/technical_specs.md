# E-commerce Performance Optimization Technical Specifications

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive technical specifications for e-commerce performance optimization in 2025, covering four critical areas: CDN and caching strategies, database optimization techniques, frontend optimization tools, and infrastructure scaling approaches. The specifications are based on parallel research across multiple authoritative sources and current industry trends.

## 1. CDN and Caching Strategies

### 1.1 Multi-Layered Caching Architecture

**Core Strategy:**
- Implement a hierarchical caching system with Browser Cache → CDN Edge Cache → Origin Shield → Origin Server
- Use content-specific caching policies with static assets cached for 1-7 days, dynamic content for 5-60 minutes
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation for commerce data with up to 3-5ms response times for cached resources

**Advanced Caching Techniques:**
- **Dynamic Content Caching**: Cache frequently changing content (user accounts, location-specific products, inventory)
- **Edge-Side Includes (ESI)**: Cache static page portions while dynamically generating personalized content
- **Request Collapsing**: Combine multiple requests for the same object into a single origin request
- **Origin Shielding**: Reduce origin strain by minimizing requests and data served

### 1.2 CDN Performance Optimization

**Content Delivery Strategies:**
- **AI-Driven Edge Optimization**: Use machine learning to predict user behavior and proactively cache assets
- **Advanced Compression**: Implement Brotli or Zopfli compression for 20-30% better compression ratios
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic format conversion (WebP, AVIF) with lazy loading and responsive images
- **Critical Resource Prioritization**: Preload critical CSS/JS, defer non-essential assets

**Performance Targets:**
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.5 seconds

### 1.3 E-commerce Specific Optimizations

**Dynamic Commerce Data Handling:**
- **Product Catalog Caching**: Cache product listings with 15-30 minute TTL, invalidate on inventory changes
- **Personalization at Edge**: Use edge computing for user-specific recommendations without origin requests
- **Cart State Management**: Cache cart state at edge with real-time synchronization
- **Price/Inventory Updates**: Implement streaming updates for real-time price changes

**Business Impact Metrics:**
- 1-second delay = 7% reduction in conversions
- 88% of users avoid platforms after negative experiences
- 53% leave if load time exceeds 3 seconds
