- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Under 0.1

**Industry Performance Statistics:**
- Only 38% of 1.8 million URLs pass all Core Web Vitals across sectors
- The highest e-commerce conversion rates (average 3.05%) occur on pages that load in 1-2 seconds
- Global e-commerce conversion rate averages between 2-4% in 2025

### Performance Benchmarks by Device

**Desktop Performance:**
- Top e-commerce sites load in 2.5 seconds on desktop
- Desktop LCP leaders: Sephora (75.12%), Bath & Body Works (71.95%), Young Living (69.59%)

**Mobile Performance:**
- Average webpage takes 87.8% longer to load on mobile than desktop
- Mobile traffic comprises 59% of all web traffic
- Mobile LCP leaders: Bath & Body Works (68.37%), Ulta (67.60%), MAC Cosmetics (65.85%)

### Business Impact Metrics

**Conversion Rate Impact:**

- Sites loading in 1 second have conversion rates 2.5x higher than sites loading in 5 seconds
- A 1-second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by 7%
- Every 100-millisecond improvement in load time can boost conversion rates by up to 7%

**Revenue Impact:**
- Decreasing mobile page load speed by 1 second improves conversion rates by 5.9%
- A 0.1-second improvement in mobile site speed increases retail conversions by 8.4%
- Improving average page speed by 1 second can generate an extra $1.8 million annually for larger e-commerce sites

## 2. Common Performance Bottlenecks in E-commerce Sites

### Image-Related Issues

**Primary Concerns:**
- Images are the biggest files on e-commerce sites, loading on every category, product, and promotional page
- 45% of top 100 e-commerce sites don't compress their images
- Large, unoptimized images significantly impact LCP scores
- Heavy product images and videos cause layout shifts affecting CLS

**Mobile-Specific Challenges:**
- 46% of people say waiting for pages to load is what they dislike most about browsing on mobile
- 85% of mobile users expect pages to load as fast or faster than desktop
- 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load

### JavaScript and Resource Loading

**Common Issues:**
- Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS files
- Unoptimized font files causing FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text) or FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)
- Heavy third-party integrations and plugins
- Large video files and auto-playing embeds

### Infrastructure and Traffic Issues

**Traffic-Induced Problems:**
- IT brownouts during high-traffic periods (e.g., Black Friday)
- Server response time degradation under load
- Database query optimization issues
- CDN configuration problems

**Case Study Example:**
During Black Friday, Pet Smart's load speed nearly doubled from 7.7 seconds to 13.84 seconds, demonstrating the impact of traffic spikes on performance.
